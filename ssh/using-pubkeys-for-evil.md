SSH pubkeys can be used to identify you outside of the context in which most people use them. GitHub publicizes pubkeys ans SSH has a nasty habit of throwing all of your pubkeys at a server when trying to log in. Using those two things, if you\'re on github and you are ssh\'ing from a computer with the corresponding key pair, the server can potentially identify who you are in the real world.
